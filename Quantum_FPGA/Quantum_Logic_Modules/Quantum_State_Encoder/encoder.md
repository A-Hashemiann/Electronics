### 1. Inputs and Outputs
- **`input_state`**: A 2-bit input specifying the quantum state to encode:
  - `"00"`: |0⟩
  - `"01"`: |1⟩
  - `"10"`: |+⟩
  - `"11"`: |−⟩
- **`output_real`** and **`output_imag`**: 8-bit outputs representing the real and imaginary parts of the encoded quantum state.

### 2. Constants
- States are encoded as fixed-point binary values representing amplitudes in the range of [−1, 1].

### 3. Process
- A `case` statement selects the appropriate encoding based on the `input_state`.

### 4. State Encoding
- **|0⟩** and **|1⟩** are encoded as:
  - |0⟩: (1 + 0j)
  - |1⟩: (0 + 0j)
- **|+⟩** and **|−⟩** are encoded as:
  - |+⟩: (0.707 + 0.707j)
  - |−⟩: (0.707 − 0.707j)
- The amplitudes are approximated as fixed-point binary values.
