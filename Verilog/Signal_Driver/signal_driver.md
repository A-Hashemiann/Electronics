# Signal Drivers
A signal driver in VHDL is an element that sets a signal's value. In particular, it is a procedure, a concurrent statement, or a specific instance of a component that gives a signal a value. Since signal drivers specify how signals change over time based on the logic outlined in the VHDL code, they are crucial for simulating hardware behavior.
