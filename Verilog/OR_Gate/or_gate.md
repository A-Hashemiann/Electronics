# Digital Logic: OR Gate
In digital logic, an OR gate is a fundamental logic gate that performs a logical OR operation. It takes two or more binary inputs and produces a single binary output. The output is true (logic high, typically represented by '1') if at least one of the inputs is true; otherwise, the output is false (logic low, typically represented by '0').

## Truth Table

The truth table for a two-input OR gate is as follows:

| Input A | Input B | Output F |
|---------|---------|----------|
|    0    |    0    |     0    |
|    0    |    1    |     1    |
|    1    |    0    |     1    |
|    1    |    1    |     1    |

In this truth table:
- If either input A or input B is 1, the output F is 1.
- The output F is 0 only when both input A and input B are 0.

## Symbol Representation

An OR gate is represented by the following symbol:

In this symbol:
- A and B are input terminals.
- F (out) is the output terminal.
- The OR symbol represents the logical OR operation performed by the gate.
